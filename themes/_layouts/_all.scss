//  A layout is a structure that holds other modules,
//  and only modules. It does not contain atoms, since only
//  modules contain atoms.
//
//  A layout is not a template. A template is a page-level
//  thing: a layout could be thought of as a module expressly
//  for containing modules. It is simply a re-usable structure or
//  scaffolding.
//
//  Examples: a grid system, a masonry layout. These are pretty
//  specific, so there probably won't be too many of these in a site.
