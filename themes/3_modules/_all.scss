//  A module is a collection of more than three atoms,
//  intended to be re-used across the site.
//
//  Emphasis is on the re-use aspect. So a page for a
//  specific blogpost might contain an arrangement of
//  atoms, but that arrangement is expressly for the
//  blog post page; you wouldn't re-use that "page-title
//  and metadata and content" collection anywhere else.
//  That's a template. That arrangement appears only once
//  per page, and just in that section.
//
//  Whereas the blog-post-entry collection is used multiple
//  times on the homepage and archive pages, so that would
//  be a module.

@import "_blogpost-module";
@import "_navigation";
@import "_previousnext";
@import "_page-intro";

//  These modules are specific to the site template
@import "_tmp-sitename";
