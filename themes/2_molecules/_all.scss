//  exact differences between a molecule and an organism
//  (module in this case); just that molecules are simpler.
//  So I'm going to say that a molecule is three atoms or
//  less.
//
//  So a call-to-action link would be a molecule. A simple
//  search box (which Frost did include as an example) would
//  be a molecule. A blog post would be a module.
//
//  (I thought of designating a CTA link as an atom, but it's
//  hard to do that since it would be comprised of atoms, like
//  an icon, a link, etc.)
